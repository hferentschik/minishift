# Minishift

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift
cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.

Minishift uses [libmachine](https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine) for
provisioning VMs, and [OpenShift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin) for running the cluster.

## Installation

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

Minishift requires a hypervisor to run the virtual machine containing OpenShift. Depending on your
host OS, you have the choice of the following hypervisors:

* OS X
    * [xhyve](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion)
* Linux
    * [KVM](./docs/docker-machine-drivers.md#kvm-driver) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Windows
    * [Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt169373.aspx) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Minishift ships with drivers for VirtualBox and VMware Fusion out of the box. Other drivers
require manual installation, see [docker machine drivers installation](./docs/docker-machine-drivers.md) for more details.

Drivers can be selected via the `--vm-driver=xxx` flag of `minishift start` as mentioned in the [Starting Minishift](#starting-minishift) section below. See the [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting.md#kvm-drivers) guide, in case you encounter any issues.

**Note:**
- For most hypervisors, VT-x/AMD-v virtualization must be enabled in the BIOS. For Hyper-V, however,
it needs to be disabled.
- We recommend that you use `Virtualbox >= 5.1.12` on Windows to avoid the issue

### Installing Minshift

Download the archive matching your host OS from the Minishift [releases page](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases) and unpack it. Copy the contained binary to your preferred
location and optionally ensure it is added to your _PATH_.

**Note**: Due to issue [#236](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/236), you need to execute the minishift binary on Windows OS from the drive containing your %USERPROFILE% directory.

<a name="installing-via-homebrew"></a>
#### Installing via Homebrew

##### Stable
On OS X you can also use [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) to install the stable version of Minishift:

```sh
  $ brew cask install minishift
```

##### Latest Beta
If you want to install the latest beta version of Minishift you will need the homebrew-cask versions tap. After you install homebrew-cask, run the following command:

```sh
  $ brew tap caskroom/versions
```

You can now install the latest beta version of minishift.

```sh
  $ brew cask install minishift-beta
```

## Quickstart

This section contains a brief demo of Minishift and the provisoned OpenShift instance.
For details on the usage of Minishift refer to the [Using Minishift](/docs/using.md) guide.
The interaction with OpenShift is via the command line tool _oc_ which is copied to your host.

<a name="starting-minishift"></a>
### Starting Minishift

1. Assuming you have put _minishift_  on the _PATH_ as described in [Installing Minishift](#installing-minshift) you can start Minishift via:

        $ minishift start
        Starting local OpenShift cluster...
        ...
           OpenShift server started.
           The server is accessible via web console at:
               https://192.168.99.128:8443

           You are logged in as:
               User:     developer
               Password: developer

           To login as administrator:
               oc login -u system:admin

    Note that, the IP seen above is dynamic and can change. It can be retrieved with `minishift ip`.

    **Note:** By default Minishift uses the driver most relevant to the host OS.
To use a driver of choice for Minishift, use the `--vm-driver=xxx` flag with `minishift start`. For example, to use VirtualBox instead of KVM for Fedora, use `minishift start --vm-driver=virtualbox`.

1. Add `oc` binary to the _PATH_:

     **Note:** How to modify the _PATH_ varies depending on host OS, version of the OC binary and
     other variables. In case of doubt, you can check the content of the
     `~/.minishift/cache/oc` directory.

        $ export PATH=$PATH:~/.minishift/cache/oc/v1.3.1

1. Login to your OpenShift account and authenticate yourself:

        $ oc login https://192.168.99.128:8443 -u developer -p developer

<a name="deploying-a-sample-application"></a>
### Deploying a sample application

You can use Minishift to run a sample Node.js application on OpenShift as follows:

1. Create a Node.js example app:

        $ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp

1. Track the build log until the app is built and deployed using:

        $ oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex

1. Expose a route to the service as follows:

        $ oc expose svc/nodejs-ex

1. Access the app:

        $ curl http://nodejs-ex-myproject.192.168.99.128.xip.io

1. To stop Minishift, use:

        $ minishift stop
        Stopping local OpenShift cluster...
        Stopping "minishift"...

<a name="reusing-the-docker-daemon"></a>
### Reusing the Docker daemon

When running OpenShift in a single VM, it is recommended to reuse the Docker daemon which Minishift uses
for pure Docker use-cases as well.
By using the same docker daemon as Minishift, you can speed up your local experiments.

To be able to work with the docker daemon on your Mac/Linux host use the
[`docker-env command`](./docs/minishift_docker-env.md) in your shell:

```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```

You should now be able to use _docker_ on the command line of your host, talking to the docker daemon
inside the Minishift VM:
```
docker ps
```
