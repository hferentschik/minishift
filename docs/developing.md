<a name="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

* Git
* A recent Go distribution (>1.7)

**Note**: You should be able to develop on Minishift on any OS - Linux, OS X or Windows. The latter
has some gotchas to be aware about, but this guide tries to point them out to you.

## Setting up the developing environment

<a name="creating-the-go-workspace"></a>
### Creating the Go workspace

In case you are new to Go development or you have not done though for some other reason, we highly
recommend to setup a default Go [workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces).
Even though it might need some getting used to for many, the idea is to have a single workspace for
all Go development. Create the following directories in the base directory you want to use, eg
_$HOME/work_:

* src (contains Go source files)
* pkg (contains package objects)
* bin (contains executable commands)

Then point the _GOPATH_ variable to this directory:

    $ export GOPATH=$HOME/work

And add the workspace _bin_ directory to your PATH:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

**Note**: The same applies for Windows users, but one uses the UI to set the environment variables or
makes use of _setx_.

<a name="cloning-the-repository"></a>
### Cloning the repository

Next you want to get the Minishift sources:

    $ cd $GOPATH/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/minishift/minishift.git github.com/minishift/minishift

<a name="using-an-ide"></a>
### Using an IDE

You are basically free to use whatever editor fancies you, however, most of the core maintainers
of Minishift use Intellij's [Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with its latest Go plugin.
Not only does it index your whole workspace and allows for easy navigation of the sources, but it
also integrates with the Go debugger [Delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve). You find
instructions on how to setup Idea [here](http://hadihariri.com/2015/09/30/setting-up-go-on-intellij/).

<a name="managing-dependencies"></a>
## Managing dependencies

Minishift uses [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for dependency management.

<a name="installing-glide"></a>
### Installing Glide

Before being able to use Glide you need to install it via:

    $ go get github.com/Masterminds/glide

This will install the _glide_ binary into _$GOPATH/bin_. Make sure to have a Glide version _>=0.12.3_.

<a name="bootstrapping-dependencies"></a>
### Bootstrapping dependencies

After a clean checkout or after a `make clean`, there won't be a _vendor_ directory containing the
needed Minishift dependencies. You first need to install them via Glide:

    $ make vendor

or by calling the underlying Glide command directly:

    $ glide install -v

**Note**: On Windows you might get problems with too long pathnames in some of the dependencies.
To work around this problem you can use a non default tmp directory for Glide which will shorten
the total path lengths:

    $ mkdir c:\tmp
    $ glide --tmp C:\tmp install -v

<a name="updating-dependencies"></a>
### Updating dependencies

If your work requires a change to the dependencies, edit _glide.yaml_ adding or changing the
dependency list as needed. Next remove _glide.lock_ and re-create the vendor directory by
[bootstrapping](#bootstrapping-dependencies) it. Glide will recognize that there is no lock
file and recalculate the required dependencies. Once complete, there will be an updated
_glide.lock_ file which you then check in together with the updated _glide.yaml_.

Double check everything still compiles with the new lock file in place.

In some cases Glide does not properly reset the state of its cache, leading for unexpected versions
ending up in _glide.lock_. In this occurs or to be generally on the safe side, one can clear the 
Glide cache prior to updating any dependencies:

    $ glide cc

## Building Minishift

<a name="building-the-minishift-binary"></a>
### Building the Minishift binary

The following command will create a platform specific binary and copy it to _$GOPATH/bin_.

```shell
make
```

**Note**: using `make cross` you can cross-compile for other platforms.

<a name="running-the-minishift-binary"></a>
### Running the Minishift binary

Starting the OpenShift cluster using your built minishift binary:

```shell
$ minishift start
```

The above command will execute  _$GOPATH/bin/minishift_, provided you have set set up your
Go workspace as described [above](#creating-the-go-workspace).

You can also execute the binaries directly from the _out_ directory of the checkout.
You will find the binary, depending on your OS, in:
*  _out/darwin-amd64_
*  _out/linux-amd64_
*  _out/windows-amd64_

For more minishift commands and flags refer to its [synopsis](./minishift.md).

<a name="running-tests"></a>
### Running Tests

<a name="unit-tests"></a>
#### Unit Tests

Unit tests get run on Travis before code is merged. To run as part of a development cycle:

```shell
make test
```

To run specific tests, use one of the following approach:

- Run tests within entire package

        # Eg: go test -v ./cmd/minikube/cmd
        go test -v <relative path of package>

- Run a single test

        go test -v <relative path of package> -run <Testcase Name>

- Run tests matching pattern

        go test -v <relative path of package> -run "Test<Regex pattern to match tests>"


Run `go test --help` to read more about test options.

<a name="integration-tests"></a>
#### Integration Tests

\<WIP\> - see also GitHub issue [#135](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/135)

<a name="formatting-the-source"></a>
### Formatting the source

Minishift adheres to the Go formatting [guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting).
Wrongly formatted code won't pass the CI builds. You can check which of your files are violating the
guidelines via:

    $ make fmtcheck

Or you can let violations be corrected directly:

    $ make fmt

<a name="cleaning-all"></a>
### Cleaning all

To remove all generated artifacts and installed dependencies, run:

    $ make clean


<a name="ci-setup"></a>
## CI Setup

Minishift uses several CI build servers. Amongst it [CentOS CI](https://ci.centos.org/).
It builds incoming pull requests and any pushes to master. Is also archives build artifacts of successful builds.
You can find the CentOS CI Jenkins job for Minishift [here](https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift/).

The artifacts of a successful pull request build can be found at
[artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/pr/\<PR ID\>](http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/pr/).

Artifacts of a successful master build can be found at
[artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/master/\<BUILD ID\>](http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/master/).

For more information about CentOS CI, check out its [Wiki](https://wiki.centos.org/QaWiki/CI) to
know more about CentOS CI.

## Releasing Minishift

<a name="prerequisites-1"></a>
### Prerequisites

* A [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)
  defined in your environment as GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN

<a name="cutting-the-release"></a>
### Cutting the release

* Bump the Minishift version in the [Makefile](../Makefile)
* Run `make gendocs` to rebuild the docs
* Commit and push your changes with a message of the form "cut v1.0.0"
* Create binaries and upload them to GitHub (this will also tag the release):

        $ make release
