== Updating Minishift

Update the Minishift binary as follows:

----
$ minishift update
----

This command checks whether there is a newer version of Minishift available.
If so, it prompts user to confirm the update, downloads the new binary and replaces the current version of Minishift.

NOTE: It is recommended to perform the `update` operation after a link:../command-ref/minishift_delete{outfilesuffix}[`minishift delete`] to avoid any backward compatibility issues.
