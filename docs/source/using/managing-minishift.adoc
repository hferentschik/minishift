[[managing-minishift-overview]]
== Overview

When you use Minishift, you interact with two components:

- a virtual machine (VM) created by Minishift
- the OpenShift cluster provisioned by Minishift within the VM

The following sections contain information about managing the Minishift VM.
For details about using Minishift to manage your local OpenShift cluster,
see the link:../using/interacting-with-openshift{outfilesuffix}[Interacting with OpenShift] section.

[[minishift-life-cycle]]
== Minishift life-cycle

[[minishift-start]]
=== Minishift start

The link:../command-ref/minishift_start{outfilesuffix}[`minishift start`] command creates and
configures the Minishift VM and provisions a local, single-node
OpenShift instance within the VM.

The command also copies the `oc` binary to your host so that you can interact
with OpenShift through the `oc` command line tool or through the Web console,
which can be accessed through the URL provided in the output
of the `minishift start` command.

[[minishift-stop]]
=== Minishift stop

The link:../command-ref/minishift_stop{outfilesuffix}[`minishift stop`] command stops your OpenShift cluster and
shuts down the Minishift VM, but preserves the OpenShift cluster state.

Starting Minishift again will restore the OpenShift cluster, allowing
you to continue working from the last session. However, you must enter the same
parameters that you used in the original start command.

Efforts to further refine this experience are in progress. For details, see
the GitHub issue https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/179[#179].

[[minishift-delete]]
=== Minishift delete

The link:../command-ref/minishift_delete{outfilesuffix}[`minishift delete`] command deletes the OpenShift cluster,
and also shuts down and deletes the Minishift VM. No data or state are preserved.

[[choosing-iso-image]]
== Choosing the ISO image

When you start Minishift, it downloads a live ISO image that the hypervisor uses to
provision the Minishift VM.

The following ISO images are available:

- link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift-b2d-iso/releases[Minishift Boot2Docker] (Default). This ISO image is
based on link:https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker[Boot2Docker], which is a
lightweight Linux distribution customized to run Docker containers. This ISO image size is small and
optimized for development but not for production.

- link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift-centos-iso/releases[Minishift CentOS]. This ISO image is based on
link:https://www.centos.org/[CentOS], which is an enterprise-ready Linux distribution that more
closely resembles a production environment. This ISO image size is larger than the Boot2Docker ISO image.

By default, Minishift uses the **Minishift Boot2Docker** ISO image. To choose the Minishift CentOS ISO image instead,
you can do one of the following actions:

- Set the `--iso-url` flag when you run `minishift start` and enter the download URL of the
Minishift CentOS ISO image. For example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ minishift start --iso-url https://github.com/minishift/minishift-centos-iso/releases/download/{centos-iso-version}/minishift-centos7.iso
----
- Manually download the Minishift CentSO ISO image from the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift-centos-iso/releases[releases page]
and enter the path to the ISO image location in the following format:

----
$ minishift start --iso-url file:///<path_to_ISO_image>
----

NOTE: You cannot run Minishift with both ISO images concurrently. To switch between
ISO images, delete the Minishift instance and start a new instance with the ISO image that you want to use.

[[runtime-options]]
== Runtime options

The runtime behavior of Minishift can be controlled through flags,
environment variables, and persistent configuration options.

The following precedence order is applied to control the behavior of
Minishift. Each action in the following list takes precedence over
the action below it:

.  Use command-line flags as specified in the link:#flags[Flags] section.
.  Set environment variables as described in the
link:#environment-variables[Environment variables] section.
.  Use persistent configuration options as described in the
link:#persistent-configuration[Persistent configuration] section.
.  Accept the default value as defined by Minishift.

[[flags]]
=== Flags

You can use command line flags with Minishift to specify options and
direct its behavior. This has the highest precedence. Almost all
commands have flags, although different commands might have different flags.
Some of the commonly used command line flags of the `minishift start`
command are `cpus`, `memory` or `vm-driver`.

[[environment-variables]]
=== Environment variables

Minishift allows you to specify command-line flags you commonly use
through environment variables.
To do so, apply the following rules to the flag you want to set as an
environment variable.

.  Apply `MINISHIFT_` as a prefix to the flag you want to set as an
environment variable. For example, the `vm-driver` flag
 of the link:../command-ref/minishift_start{outfilesuffix}[`minishift start`] command becomes
`MINISHIFT_vm-driver`.
.  Use uppercase characters for the flag, so `MINISHIFT_vm-driver` in the above
example becomes `MINISHIFT_VM-DRIVER`.
.  Replace `-` with `_`, so `MINISHIFT_VM-DRIVER` becomes `MINISHIFT_VM_DRIVER`.

Environment variables can be used to replace any option of any Minishift
command. A common example is the URL of the ISO to be used. Usually, you
specify it with the `iso-url` flag of the `minishift start` command.
Applying the above rules, you can also specify this URL by setting the environment
variable as `MINISHIFT_ISO_URL`.

NOTE: You can also use the `MINISHIFT_HOME` environment variable, to
choose a different home directory for Minishift. By default, Minishift
places all runtime state into `~/.minishift`. This environment variable is
currently experimental and semantics might change in future releases.

[[persistent-configuration]]
=== Persistent configuration

Using persistent configuration allows you to control the Minishift
behavior without specifying actual command line flags, similar to the
way you use link:#environment-variables[environment variables].

Minishift maintains a configuration file in
`$MINISHIFT_HOME/config/config.json`. This file can be
used to set commonly-used command-line flags persistently.

NOTE: Persistent configuration can only be applied to the set of
supported configuration options that are listed in the synopsis of the
link:../command-ref/minishift_config{outfilesuffix}[`minishift config`] sub-command, unlike
environment variables that can be used to replace any option of any
command.

[[setting-persistent-configuration-values]]
==== Setting persistent configuration values

The easiest way to change a persistent configuration option is with
the link:../command-ref/minishift_config_set{outfilesuffix}[`config set`] sub-command. For example:

[listing.console]

----
# Set default memory 4096 MB
$ minishift config set memory 4096
----

To view all persistent configuration values, you can use the
link:../command-ref/minishift_config_view{outfilesuffix}[`view`] sub-command:

[listing.console]

----
$ minishift config view
- memory: 4096
----

Alternatively, you can display a single value with the
link:../command-ref/minishift_config_get{outfilesuffix}[`get`] sub-command:

[listing.console]

----
$ minishift config get memory
4096
----

[[unsetting-persistent-configuration-values]]
==== Unsetting persistent configuration values

To remove a persistent configuration option, you can use the
link:../command-ref/minishift_config_unset{outfilesuffix}[`unset`] sub-command. For example:

[listing.console]

----
$ minishift config unset memory
----

[[driver-specific-environment-variables]]
=== Driver specific environment variables

You can also specify driver specific environment variables. Each
docker-machine driver supports its own set of options and variables. A good starting point is the
official docker-machine link:https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/[driver documentation].
xhyve and KVM documentation is available under their respective GitHub repository
link:https://github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve[docker-machine-driver-xhyve]
and https://github.com/dhiltgen/docker-machine-kvm[docker-machine-kvm].

To use driver specific options make sure to export the variable as defined in its driver documentation
prior to calling link:../command-ref/minishift_start{outfilesuffix}[`minishift start`]. For example,
xhyve's experimental NFS sharing can be enabled by executing:

----
$ export XHYVE_EXPERIMENTAL_NFS_SHARE=true
$ minishift start --vm-driver xhyve
----

CAUTION: Driver specific options might overlap with values specified using Minishift
specific flags and environment variables. Examples are boot2docker URL, memory size, cpu count, etc.
In this case driver specific environment variables will override Minishift specific settings.

[[persistent-volumes]]
== Persistent Volumes

As part of the <<interacting-with-openshift#openshift-client-binary,cluster up>> provisioning
100 link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[persistent volumes] are created
for your OpenShift cluster. This allows applications to make
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html#persistent-volumes-claims-as-volumes-in-pods[persistent volumes claims]. The location of the persistent data is determined via the _host-pv-dir_ flag
of the link:../command-ref/minishift_start{outfilesuffix}[`start`] command and defaults to
_/var/lib/minishift/openshift.local.pv_ on the Minishift VM.

[[http-s-proxies]]
== HTTP/HTTPS Proxies

If you are behind a HTTP/HTTPS proxy, you need to supply proxy options to allow Docker and OpenShift to work properly.
To do this, pass the required flags during `minishift start`.

For example:

----
$ minishift start --http-proxy http://YOURPROXY:PORT --https-proxy https://YOURPROXY:PORT
----

In an authenticated proxy environment, the `proxy_user` and
`proxy_password` must be a part of proxy URI.

----
 $ minishift start --http-proxy http://<proxy_username>:<proxy_password>@YOURPROXY:PORT \
                   --https-proxy https://<proxy_username>:<proxy_password>@YOURPROXY:PORT
----

You can also use the `--no-proxy` flag to specify a comma-separated list of hosts that should not be proxied.

Using the proxy options will transparently configure the Docker daemon as well as OpenShift to use the specified proxies.

NOTE: `minishift start` honors the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`.
If these variables are set, they are implicitly used during `minishift start` unless explicitly overridden by the corresponding command line flags.

NOTE: Using the proxy options requires that you run OpenShift version 1.5.0 or later.
Use the `openshift-version` option to request a specific version of OpenShift. You can list all Minishift-compatible OpenShift versions with the link:../command-ref/minishift_openshift_version_list{outfilesuffix}[`minishift openshift version list`] command.

[[networking]]
== Networking

The Minishift VM is exposed to the host system with a host-only IP address that
can be obtained with the `minishift ip` command.

[[connecting-with-ssh]]
== Connecting to the Minishift VM with SSH

You can use the xref:../command-ref/minishift_ssh{outfilesuffix}[`minishift ssh`] command to interact with the Minishift VM.

You can run `minishift ssh` without a sub-command to open an interactive shell. You can then run commands on the
Minishift VM in the same way that you run commands interactively on any remote machine using SSH.

You can also run the command with a sub-command. Minishift then sends the command to the Minishift VM and returns
the result to your local shell. For example:

----
minishift ssh -- docker ps
----
